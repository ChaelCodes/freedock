# Free Dock

Do you use a bikeshare? Tired of arriving and having the station full? Me, too!

[Free dock](https://freedock.app) allows you to create a list of your favorite destination systems and provides up-to-date availability status, especially how many docks are free.

You can pick your city's bikeshare program, then make a list of your favorite destination stations. This list can then be bookmarked for easy checking while you ride.
